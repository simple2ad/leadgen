# Testing Your Local Application

## âœ… Node.js v22.21.0 is Installed

You've successfully installed Node.js v22.21.0 with nvm. Now let's test your application locally.

## ðŸš€ Quick Test Commands

Run these commands **in your terminal** (not through me):

### 1. Verify Node.js Version
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```
Should show: `v22.21.0` and `v10.9.4`

### 2. Reinstall Dependencies
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### 3. Push Database Schema
```bash
npx drizzle-kit push
```

### 4. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Test the Application
- Open browser to: `http://localhost:3000/test-user`
- Submit an email to test lead capture
- Check if it redirects to thank you page

## ðŸ”§ If You Still See Old Node.js Version

If `node --version` still shows v14.16.1, run:

```bash
# Make sure nvm is loaded
source ~/.zshrc

# Set default Node.js version
nvm alias default node
nvm use default

# Verify
node --version
```

## ðŸ“‹ What to Expect

**After successful setup:**
- Development server starts on `http://localhost:3000`
- Lead capture form at `http://localhost:3000/test-user`
- Database tables created automatically
- Real-time lead tracking in dashboard

## ðŸŽ¯ Production Status

Your application is **already deployed and working** on Vercel. This local testing is optional but recommended for development.

**Live URLs:**
- Lead Capture: `https://your-app.vercel.app/test-user`
- Dashboard: `https://your-app.vercel.app/dashboard` (via Whop)
