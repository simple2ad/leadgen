   - **Description**: "Multi-tenant lead generation system with Whop authentication"
   - **Visibility**: Public or Private (choose based on your preference)
   - **Initialize with README**: Leave UNCHECKED (we already have one)
   - **Add .gitignore**: Leave UNCHECKED (we already have one)
   - **Add a license**: Optional, you can add MIT license if you want

4. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, you'll see instructions for pushing an existing repository. Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/leadgen-saas.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify the Push

After running the commands, refresh your GitHub repository page. You should see all your project files there.

## Alternative: Using GitHub CLI

If you have GitHub CLI installed, you can create and push in one step:

```bash
gh repo create leadgen-saas --description "Multi-tenant lead generation system with Whop authentication" --public --push --source=.
```
