### 🔧 Local Development (Optional)
Since you have Node.js v22.21.0 installed, you can test locally:

```bash
# In your terminal (not subagent):
node --version  # Should show v22.21.0

# Reinstall dependencies:
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# If Drizzle fails, use manual SQL:
```

**Manual Database Setup SQL:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS clients (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  whop_user_id TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  email TEXT,
  username TEXT UNIQUE,
  webhook_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS leads (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  client_id UUID REFERENCES clients(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
